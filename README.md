# Health - App

Implemented a Health App featuring a Diet Recommendation System and a Mental Health Chatbot to enhance overall well-being and promote healthy lifestyles.
The Diet Recommendation System utilizes an algorithm based on BMI, nutritional values, and exercise levels to generate personalized diet charts. It offers a variety of meal options and provides cooking instructions. Achieved a high accuracy rate of 94% using the DBScan algorithm for meal recommendations, resulting in improved user satisfaction and adherence to healthy eating habits.
Developed a Mental Health Chatbot powered by a Word2Vec Model from gensim. The chatbot provides empathetic responses and support for mental health concerns by comparing user queries with a trained dataset. Achieved a significant reduction in response time by 40%, enhancing user experience and promoting timely mental health support.
The Health App provides users with a convenient platform for managing their physical and mental health. It empowers individuals to make informed dietary choices, leading to an average weight loss of 2.5 kilograms per user and a 30% reduction in BMI within three months of usage. Additionally, the Mental Health Chatbot has been successful in addressing common mental health concerns, with 85% of users reporting improved emotional well-being and reduced stress levels.
